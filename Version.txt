2.7 - 27/3/2018
      Nodal and Vertex coupled. 
      Wound size as a function of nx and ny.
      Rest length changes (gamma) on vertex or nodal elements
      Incremental and non-incremental non-homogensous boundary conditions 
      Default values for all parameters

3.0  Computation of projected areas
     Added Delay
     Profiler
     Strain Based elasticity

3.1  Different stiffness at the spring branch (k0) and active branch (k)
     Output of resting length

3.5 1/8/2018 Use of input file InputData.m.

3.7. 26/10/2010
     non-hexagonal cells are permitted.
     Cell-Centres from experimental allowed (Set.CellCentres=file with cell centres coordinates)
     Remodelling at each increment allowed, with graded Delaunay if necessary (Set.RemodelDelta)
     Penalisation of volume is with respect RELATIVE volume.
3.9  Remodelling with projection of relaxed vertices at wound edge is corrected.
4.0  Added free z coordinate on basal.
4.1. Added option Set.yRelaxationZ, in order to relax Z coordinates of all top vertices.
4.2. Quadriples size of tissue. SetDefault.RelaxationYZ=false.
4.3. Time intensity factor for contractilty at wound edge Set.TimeCTWE, Set.TimeCBWE, Set.TimeCLWE.
     Set.EpsCTWE, Set.EpsCLWE and Set.EpsCBWE are applied not proportionally, since time eovlution vector modulate it.
4.4  Non-hexagonal cells
4.5  Different top and contractility
     Non-constant contracitlity through variables Set.StartTimeEcLat, Set.PeakTimeEcLat, 
Set.EndTimeEcLat.
4.6  Non-constant time-step, use of variable Set.t replacing Set.tend and Set.dt.
4.7  Amended step-halving. Cells the become external are internalised during Remodelling, so that external nodes do not change.      Orientation of wound ring is always counterclockwise (bug).
     Amended correction of DelaunayR in order to avoid cahttering (based on perimeter, not cirumradius)
     Use Set.RemodelExternal for avoiding rermodelling of externalnodes.
4.8  - Adding propulsion forces acting on bottom nodes, 
     - Adding viscos friction with bottom vertices  
4.9  Ammended sorting of externalnodes when domains are joined by single node.
